### leetcode-column_add-script

Javascript Snippet for locally populating the leetcode problems table with API response data.

leetcode.com/problemset/all/ page displays problems in a tabular format. This script adds an additional column, locally, with **total accepted submissions / total number of times submitted** figures for each problem. This data is fetched from the api - leetcode.com/api/problems/all/
